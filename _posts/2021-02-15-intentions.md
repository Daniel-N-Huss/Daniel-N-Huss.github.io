# "Who Am I?"
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *another impossible question*

&nbsp;

Why have I written this article 3 times before posting it? Each time I was trying to polish up my story to look pretty it condensed into a 'generic inspirational motivating' peice of BS writing you see all those "career guru" types doing.

**That isn't what we're doing here.**

I took a weird journey to get into my current role. Often we think of 'self' in terms of our career. In that sense, I am a 'Web Developer'. I know I had a lot of luck getting into this type of role. I also know that I was prepared and able to say yes to the opportunity luck thrust at me because of a deeper sense of 'Who I Am'. Before transitioning into being a developer, I was a "Community Manager". Luck showed me the opportunity. I had the background to say yes.

&nbsp; 

When I was in the first steps of my undergrad at a community college, I re-launched a student group for our department. Later in my undergrad, my wife and I built a World of Warcraft guild and structured it around how we valued our game time, and the types of people we wanted to spend that time with. 

The student group was **flagrantly** unsuccessful because I strangled the life out of it. I learned some important lessons about building an environment for people to fill and found some pretty reasonable success with the Guild we founded applying those lessons.

I deeply valued both of those experiences. I made personal connections with 50+ humans in a videogame. Facing the failure and completely awful job I did with the student group showed me I wasn't the arbiter of a community, even as it's leader. I valued both of those so much that I put them in my cover letter when I applied to the Community Manager role, and talked about them at length in my interviews.

&nbsp;

Weirdly enough, because I could articulate *why* I valued both, and how those experiences related to the Community Manager role, I was able to truly identify with the value that the job brings to the company. My genuine belief in the role and its value was infectious,  propelling me into the work and the broader Calgary tech community. 

That was the first time in my life I held a job that let me live out "Who I am". My job title was Community Manager, but the "Who I Am" in that job title was the expression of things I believe in; Authentic connection and the importance of education, in a variety of forms.

## But, Gandalf.

&nbsp;

Gandalf lives with *intention*. He shows up in unexpected ways, or at times most dire in the Lord of the Rings saga. 


      He arrives precisely when he means to.


I think living with intention is the way we roadtest and prove that we truly hold a value. I can tell you that I *value* community, but until I step into testing out what those values mean in the world they're just words. The magic comes in the actions of living out those values, in making something immaterial into something real. 

I've come to learn a lot about myself through finding ways to roadtest what I believe. I've found that my job titles carry a hint of who I am, but the real insight is in the space between intention and practice. We know Gandalf is a wizard, but that title alone doesn't bestow virtue on his character. He tells us that part of his value system dictates how he engages with the world around him. Then he puts those things into practice, arriving at the Battle of Helms Deep in the precise, exact time to turn the tide of an overwhelming conflict. 

We can capture that same magic. Who you are isn't a job title, but it can hint at your values. Intentionally living out those values is where we start understanding 'Who Am I?'
