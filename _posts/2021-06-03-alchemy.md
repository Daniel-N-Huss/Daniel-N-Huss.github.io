So far there's been a lot of random esoteric rambling.

I like the esoterics. I also like the technology.

### Code is a mystery. Archaic typoglyphics that make the machine spirit bend to our will.


When we wade into software we know we're going to be learning how to make the computer
do interesting things. We pursue this art because somewhere we get enjoyment from this. Often it's hard to articulate
why.


The newly initiated (myself included) must wade through a lot of abstraction that does not make *any* sort of sense.
Yes we begin to understand the *syntax* of the words, their general meaning. To the uninitiated even a basic understanding
appears as divine knowledge of the unknowable. 

It's not, though. Anyone can learn this. 

The real skill of the masters of the craft comes from the translations. 

The beginner focuses on translating english into
machine-words. On crafting the clever illusions of the web.

The master translates intent into an architecture. The master transforms desire into a tangible form. The master does
this with minimal strain, and does it quickly. 

## The master is not focused on speaking machine.

Our journey of mastery is one of learning transformation.

Transforming frustration into knowledge.

Transforming desire into knowledge.

Transforming time into knowledge.

Transforming money into knowledge. 

Transforming doubt into knowledge.

Ultimately, the goal is to translate knowledge into knowledge.

Do not doubt your path. Your frustrations are growth, as long as you transform them. Next time, it will be easier to
achieve the transformation. And again the time after.
