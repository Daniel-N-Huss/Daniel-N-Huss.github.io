Getting ready to act is the hardest task of them all. Beginning has a lot of forces working against it. Newton's second law, the law of inertia, works against us. Restful objects want to stay restful. While objects in motion seek to stay in motion, the force of entropy inherently strips energy away. 

I'm sure you've encountered something in life that stirs the same feeling of shame as I have felt; some event or circumstance, a community, a project. Something that screams out into your world, begging to be started. Ripping and clawing at the boundaries of existence, a concept or gem of inspiration that sparks. They're always there, hungry eyes peering from beyond the veil of imagination, ready to rip into existence and change your life completely.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And, Inertia.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Coming to be is, well, hard. The hidden piece that knows, deep down, we could *create* falls ashamed every time the dual keepers of energy, Inertia and Entropy, tie their weights around the neck of the unseen. The feeling of watching a community crumble to dust, its people scattered to the winds of life. A project, too burdened by its own history crawl to a halt and finally gives out a last gasp. That brilliant idea halted in step before taking a single one. The last time two friends pick up the phone to talk, never realizing it's the end.

A trouble of being human is that we see these two beings, Intertia and Entropy, acting upon the world around us all the time. They appear as dark forces, to limit and halt our work and growth and experiences.

&nbsp;

Quite the contrary.

Pulling the Death tarot card feels frightening. Surely, death is a force to fear. An agent of Entropy, the final herald in the moments of its victory.

How, then, can we see that image, the avatar, in a different light? The delicate state between the difficult push to overcome inertia, and the inevitable pull of entropy is the thinnest thread.

Consider the opposite. To keep the energy and spark alive takes *significant* investment. To cut the weights free from the history-burdened project is no small task. The good of the plant, occasionally, requires pruning. What growth are we free to pursue when we cut back the pieces entropy and death have wrest from our clutch? 


&nbsp;

Perhaps, if we give them willingly, Inertia can turn from Guard to Guardian. Momentum built, and freed of shackles might launch us to a place where the spark, the hidden can catch fire again.
